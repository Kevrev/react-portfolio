# React Portfolio

## Description

This application uses knowledge of react to create a portfolio website. The website contains a navbar, a footer, and four pages: Portfolio, About, Resume, and Contact. The About page contains a short bio and a picture of myself. The Portfolio page hosts some of my recent projects. The Resume page has a PDF file of my resume embedded and is also downloadable. The Contact page contains a form that can be filled out to send me an email.

## Usage

Users can access the deployed GitHub pages site and browse through the different pages. The navbar at the top hosts the links to each page.

One can also view the index.html, script.js, and style.css files independently in the GitHub repository:
